# Coding Style & Documentation
- All comments MUST be in English. No Hungarian comments allowed.
- Never place comments at the end of a line. Always place them on a new line above the code.
- Use comments sparingly; only for non-obvious logic.
- Use 2-space indentation for all files.
- When writing temporary test files, use the name pattern `try_*.js`. Retain the `test_` prefix for unit test etc. files.

# Execution & Debugging
- When running tests, use the 'Debug Local Runner' launch configuration.
- Monitor terminal output for ReferenceErrors (e.g., SpreadsheetApp, UrlFetchApp).
- If a Google-specific service is missing during local execution, automatically suggest a mock in local_runner.js.

# Environment
- Use process.env.MONGO_URI for MongoDB connections.
- Always check if the current environment is Node.js vs Google Apps Script using 'typeof module'.

# Git Commit and Documentation Standards
- **Commit Tagging**: Every time you suggest a git commit or perform one, append the `#Windsurf` hashtag to the end of the subject line.
- **Conventional Commits**: Use the following prefixes:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `refactor:` for code cleanup/restructuring (like the MongoService cleanup)
  - `chore:` for maintenance or dependency updates
- **Co-author Credit**: For significant logic changes, add `Co-authored-by: Windsurf <windsurf@codeium.com>` in the commit body.
- **Contextual Comments**: Never write comments at the end of a line. Use only English for comments. Keep comments sparse and high-level.
- **Indentation**: Strictly use 2-space indentation in all files.
