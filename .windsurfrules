# Coding Style & Documentation
- All comments MUST be in English. No Hungarian comments allowed.
- Never place comments at the end of a line. Always place them on a new line above the code.
- Use comments sparingly; only for non-obvious logic.
- Use 2-space indentation for all files.
- When writing temporary test files, use the name pattern `try_*.js`. Retain the `test_` prefix for unit test etc. files.

# Execution & Debugging
- When running tests, use the 'Debug Local Runner' launch configuration.
- Monitor terminal output for ReferenceErrors (e.g., SpreadsheetApp, UrlFetchApp).
- If a Google-specific service is missing during local execution, automatically suggest a mock in local_runner.js.

# Environment
- Use process.env.MONGO_URI for MongoDB connections.
- Always check if the current environment is Node.js vs Google Apps Script using 'typeof module'.
